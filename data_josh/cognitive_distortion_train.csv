"If you do it well, it won't be cherished."
My humble seed has grown into a tree in my heart.
Why am I still alive?
"I can't be happy anymore, and I'm tired of being told that I'm disappointed, and I don't want to live, and I'm thinking about how I'm going to die, and the doctor wants me to go back to therapy, and I don't want to."
No one can save me.
I don't know if I'm depressed or weak.
"Living is dying, losing power from body to heart."
"I was thrown out today, and I had no place to go, and I knew that it was the sky that kept driving me off the road. He refused to give me 1.5 square metres of safety. I said to my cool table that you and I were poor, that the world was big, that there was no room for you and me, that perhaps your best place was the trash can, and that I was the graveyard. But I still didn't throw him in the trash because this cool seat was willing to live with me."
"I tried my best, but in the end I was thrown away. My heart was so worthless."
She's eating hotpots in her room with him. I can't stop talking. I feel like I'm too much.
I think I must have died very early.
Anxiety & nbsp; & nbsp; every day I want to jump; & nbsp; I don't know how to lay my bed every day.
"I'm here again, and I feel so miserable, I feel like I'm hopeless, I feel so sorry for my parents, I'm my age, I worry about them, I'm so incompetent."
You can't do anything. You can't do anything. I'm useless.
"Can you be so passive every day? “You're so annoying, you don't know?” “You're so bored all the time.” That's what I've heard most comfortingly: I've got my heart pierced like a knife, and I've been walking on a path full of thorns, walking around, walking around, living like a corpse, suffering. Go on with your life, and the next generation is not good enough."
"I don't want to get married, even if I am a monster, and I just want to be free."
"I don't have anything, I'm even, I'm not good at personal relationships, I don't see anything in the future, I lost a lot of weight in the last semester, my roommate says I'm a little self-centered behind my back, I try hard to adjust my mind, I laugh every day, I make myself look like I'm not alone, I'm tired every day and I can't do anything."
"Suddenly I look forward to someone coming into my life, but this is what I look like again."
The whole world really doesn't want me anymore.
"Last night we discussed with our friends how to die without pain, and then before, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and yesterday, it seemed like, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you"
"I've always thought that I'm open and strong, that I've been fooling everyone around, including my family, that I don't care about my psychological state, that I've often said something that hurts. Recently, I've been thinking more and more about suicide, and if I had the courage to eat, I'd have had the courage to live, so I wouldn't have spent every dark tomorrow."
I shouldn't trust anyone.
Maybe I deserve it. I've been a loser since I was born. I don't really deserve it. I didn't do anything.
"It's stressful, family doesn't understand, it's sad, it's prenuptial anxiety."
I'm tired. I'm not getting better.
What kind of friend is that? It looks so good.
Happy things never happen to me.
There's no light in the future.
"Every time you see an accident at a young age or a disaster, it hurts. Why would God take them away? Why not me? I'm the one who deserves to die."
"I don't want to die, I'm afraid of pain, but the self-defeating, self-confident, unconvincing self-obsessed, obnoxious, trying to kill it, but I can't, and I can't."
"I met a brother in your review today, and he wasn't happy, and I talked to him, and I wanted to bring him joy and hope, and I felt in his heart, but he didn't seem to care for my seriousness, disappointment, disappointment."
"When I got to work, I took a sick leave, but I didn't have a fever, I just didn't want to see anybody, I didn't want to smile, I didn't want to live."
"So is it depression or social fear? No, I think it's both."
"What did I do wrong? My biggest mistake was that I shouldn't have come to this world in the first place. My biggest mistake was that I should have died when I was born, that I shouldn't have come back alive after I left home."
Life is hopeless.
I can't feel myself anymore. I'm confused. I don't really have the ability to adjust. I can't understand. I can't tell. I don't know when I'm going to last.
When will the day of this heavenly hell come to an end?
"I broke up today, I begged him for so long, he was tired, he really didn't want to go with me. I know a lot of things, but I just can't get out, I've been isolated since I was a kid, I feel like I'm useless, I can't sleep alone, I can't sleep, I don't want to go to a hospital, I can't buy sleeping pills, I've swallowed a lot of anti-blacks, I've poured a lot of them in my mouth, but I still can't sleep."
Everything's gonna be all right.
"Every time you hear a teacher say something about taking responsibility, you feel useless. Every day you live just to be alive and what you're going to say."
"It's like there's no one left to trust, no family, and I feel really bad about it."
"I don't know what I want, and I don't know what I'm trying to do, and I don't know what I'm doing."
Just make me sick. I'm an evil man. You think so.
"This time they're gonna hate me. My aunt says I'm not gonna make it. What about her two kids, they're getting suffocated, and I'm leaving soon."
Aren't I supposed to exist?
"It seems like I've met such a good person recently, as well as a better appetite for sleep. Doctors have told me that people who don't know how much you know or you don't know to help you in their lives, like parents who are good to them and you can't repay them in full, but I know that I am selfish and I don't want to be responsible for anyone else except them."
But I'm such a coward.
My family and friends have abandoned me.
"I don't know what's good, what's wrong with me. I can't express myself, I can't communicate."
"I've always wanted to walk past a girl who's crying, and I've always wanted to hold her, and maybe I'm too sandy to cry, but if you're crying, I'm gonna hold you."
I guess I'm a little grumpy. I can't change the paper form to throw the computers out.
"Yesterday I finally went to a psychological consultation. It was something that I never had the courage to do before confirming that I really had one foot out of the ground. I would stay alive, but I was sure I couldn't be happy."
I guess everything's gonna be all right.
"I'm so sad today, I thought it was just depression, like I'd been crying for no reason since my grandfather died in 18 years, but I think I've never been happy."
I'm so useless. I'm so stupid. I don't even want to fall.
It's really sad. It's bothering you. I'm sorry.
"I'm still tired and tired in the morning, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired, and I'm tired."
"I want to kill myself, nobody knows I can't leave without a father, I can't be a happy sister, I can't work well, I can't give a family, I have a heavy burden, I don't want to do what I like, I don't know what I do in a strange city, I'm afraid of the dark, I sleep in a light every day, I don't feel sorry for myself in a little corner."
I don't think the world needs me anymore.
"My mom didn't want me to give up on you, either, so I slit my wrists, and I killed myself, and it really hurt, and I cut blood a little bit more, and I felt my arms, and my fingers were cold, and wondered how you died, and it hurt, and I had the courage to slit my wrists, and I failed, and I was disappointed."
Can't you stop loving because it hurts too much and I'm dying?
He'll never be a person to be cherished.
"I hate foreign trade, I hate being a customer's licking dog, I hate to hear back on holidays."
"And here I am again, going out with my friends today, going to a lot of places, and I suddenly have a weird feeling that there are so many people in the world, and I'm so tired and tired, and I don't know what I'm living for, what I'm working for, and I don't really want to do anything, and I don't want to have anything."
"Love will happen, but I don't believe it will happen to me, and I don't believe that any relationship will really last forever, and I hope that you will meet for a long time."
"I failed to live up to my time, to live up to my love and friendship, to live up to myself, to live up to all the good things, to be human."
"I'm crying again tonight, hiding in my nest and suffocating. I don't know if I have tomorrow. I don't want to be so tired. I want to be happy."
"I'm too sensitive, it's really hard..."
"Insomnia, so annoying, sometimes it's boring to think that people are alive. Feels like their best days are over. From graduation, there will be no more happiness in college."
"Sometimes I imagine that I have a knife in my hand, and then I stab it in my heart. Until one day, when I really took a knife and I was about to stab it in my heart, I threw it away like a twitch, and I started shaking and yelling at my nerves. I was so scared."
"No joy, no soul, no interest, nothing but a body."
"It's a crash. I haven't been able to say a few things in the morning, and I don't know what the answer is."
"I don't want to be cured. All the facts will never get better, and all the worst things I've ever thought of will happen. Does it make sense to pray that I'm dying, and if another man who works hard is in danger, it's a wish to replace him with me."
I'm sorry to come to you and cry with cowardice. I don't know where to begin my grief. I only know that one wound is expected to take a long time to heal.
"I didn't even have the courage to die. I thought about it a million times, but every time I went to that place, I stopped, I went back, and I was in endless misery. I didn't know how much medicine would kill me. I didn't know how long the process would take, how much pain it would hurt. I didn't know what to do with my parents, how to explain it to them, and my friends, my teachers, my relatives, when to leave it."
"I still can't adjust my mind. I don't want to go to school. I'm afraid of school. I'm just a coward. I want to tell my dad everything. I want to drop school, but I'm afraid he'll disappoint me."
I'm not having nightmares. I'm not having nightmares. No one's gonna comfort me.
I'm an insulation. I live on Earth.
"I'm really sorry, I want to hurt myself, I don't want anyone to know, I want to go home, I don't want to go home."
"I've been working a lot lately, and my leadership has been under pressure, and I feel like I can't do anything right, being a brother, not a good boy, not a good son, not a good family member, so I want to die."
"After graduation, the job didn't go well. Because I got out of school and broke up with my boyfriend. I lost a lot of money, and my mom was hit by it. I was fat for three or four months, and I couldn't sleep at night. I was supposed to give my parents a better life, and now they're more worried about me. I've got a stable job, and now I'm going home from the city I like. I can't see the future."
"There's nothing in the world that hurts me anymore; and he's away from me, and maybe it's the end."
"I'd like to make a good confession about what I've failed on the human side, because I've got a manic disorder, and I've deleted our best friend's letters. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I shouldn't be emotional about this. I shouldn't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"I really like you so much, but look at you, like the moon, bright and pure, and I'm just a dust in the dark. I can't ever get near you. I just want you to be happy forever."
"Walking in a crowded street, feeling alone like dust, drifting away with the wind."
"I forgot how many times a man collapses at night, and I'm afraid people will know they can't cry, and they won't even cry."
"I envy you, I have some fear, I have difficulty looking at people, I especially want to live alone, but I am forced to face a lot of people every day, and it is worse than death."
I'm so annoying. It's sad.
"I'm about to graduate, so I can go home and do it, but at home my parents are being talked about, and I don't know, there's no good way to think that I'm sick, that I'm going to break my body, that I'm going to die."
Is this still a boyfriend? Isn't this a total fraud?
Just make me sick.
"I don't really like my dad's ideas, I'm going to school tomorrow, and he's calling the class chief, and he's telling me what's best for me, okay, but can't you hear me? I just want to calm down, I'm really tired, I'm really tired, I'm not telling you that, and I'm really tired."
"I definitely couldn't be a good friend with him, but I really wanted to be the best friend with her."
"It's really hard to eat, I've become the psycho I saw on TV since I was a kid, and I feel like I'm in a special mood. I've always regretted why my parents didn't give birth to another brother, so I'm gone and I'm not going to hurt them."
Death will die. Release will not be spared. Death will not be spared.
"I wanted to die, I felt so bad, I lived so hard, I thought I was doing well, but I really wanted to die, and I wanted to think about it every day."
"The job is targeted by the leadership, and the colleagues say bad things behind it. Today they leave, pay no wages, pay rent this month, pay no money, and don't even have a place to live. Parents haven't been in touch for years, they've been alone, they've been trying to keep you alive, they're tired."
I don't even like myself. I feel like I'm really bad.
I hate it when I don't like to talk. Why do you want to talk to me? Why don't you just ask me? Why don't you say something against me?
"Life, it's desperate. Or my life, it's desperate. It's probably been two years, but pay off the debt."
"Every minute is suffering, the chest is sour and the tears can't stop, but I don't want it to fall."
I really like you so much that you're going crazy.
"When I wake up in the morning, I get bored, I get bored, I think of things, I'm still emotionally disturbed, extreme, or I'm fine, but as long as someone else's eyes are wrong, I want to hit him or even kill him, and then I go to hell, and, well, I'm tired, and I haven't been too slow since my last emotional breakdown."
"There are really too many ignorant and boring people around, and it's the same that you're depressed yourself. I want to cry. Can you not sleep with your sadness for a while?"
How do you get to communicate with people? It's like being isolated from the world. It's hard.
"I've done everything for him, everything, money, and body. The baby's gone. But he says I can't give him what he wants. Why am I so stupid? For three years, I've been taking care of his diet, helping him to work, trying to figure out what to do, I just want nothing, just to be with him, and why in the end? I've been fighting everything alone."
"A little emotional frustration has given me a great deal of heart, and my friends have persuaded me not to focus so much on love and love, but they can't understand that I have no father, no mother, no one to rely on, no one to know, and I have to have a trust to live on."
Sometimes I really feel like I'm a liability. I can't do anything but drag my family around.
"Let's go, I'm in love. Hope is hers, despair is hers. I'm trying to get away, but why does God bother me? It's too hard to live."
"I don't want to be born in this shitty world, and my mom says if I had had an abortion, I wouldn't have had to go through all these bad things."
"I've been crying lately, and my nerves seem to be getting more and more sensitive, and I'm having a headache, and I'm 23, and I think I've had enough, and I'm tired, but I'm afraid I have a lot of things I can't afford."
"Never understood, never needed to be understood."
"I'm so tired, I'm so tired, the weather is so good, but I'm desperate to break up. What do you want me to do? I want someone to help me cry."
There's no one in the targeted boys' program. He's an ambitious man. You can leave you in front of your interests.
"Life has never been better for me, huh? At this point, I just feel like I'm shaking and seeing again the ugliest and most disgusting side of the human heart."
"Laughing is about not trying to bring negative energy to others, but how painful it is to know that sometimes people live like clowns who act, who only care about the surface they see, and when they touch their hearts. My courage is only a few times, and almost every time I do, it may seem to the other that it is just a handful of fish, not even in his story."
"Me, too. People say I'm introverted, and I'm afraid of socialization, but I just don't know how to be with people, and I don't like being alone."
I'm so boring. Nobody wants to talk to me.
Why do people live so well? I live so bad every time.
Meals. I failed.
"I used to really think I was a pretty young girl, maybe not mature, but I'd be worth a share; I had to be in love; but why was it so hard to get close to me and run away from me?"
"I can't comfort myself with that. It's good. I'm hopeful about the future. I'm fighting for the future. I'm just a bunch of people who are dying, who want to die for fear, who are tired, who pretend to be nothing, who smile at their wounded friends and tell them to believe in the future. But I never believed that I had a future."
"Every day I just walk out the door, I feel tired, I feel tired, I feel tired, I feel tired, I feel tired."
"Every night, the sense of incompetence in life haunts me like a ghost."
"I really didn't think it would come to this point, why it's so hard to live. Why come to this world? What's the point of living?"
"My parents have divorced me since I remember, and my dad left me at my uncle's house in Shanghai since I was in the second grade, and when I was a kid, I went to school alone, and I was a person, no family, no friendship, no love."
"I thought I'd be better this time, but then again, all the negative emotions came, felt abandoned, failed, and anyone was better than me."
It's still as bad as ever. It's not all right.
"It's my favorite thing to do when I'm hanging out with a friend and watching a movie, but it's not like I'm happy, it's like I'm tired, and I want to be happy, and it's so sad."
"How to live the rest of the day, I'm scared. I hate everything now, I hate schools, I hate all kinds of exams."
Give up. I'm destined to be alone.
"Isn't it common for a late-night crash to happen? What am I trying to defend? Love isn't easy. Everything is killing me, not just me, but the world."
"With depression, it's not a good thing to be alive anymore."
"<a alt=""Aaction-type=""widget_photoview"" action-data=""object_id=1022:230597319277418808751f7037b2804a&pid=006Cwjl5ly1wkun48308caa2&mid=342488764210&cid=4317782736&short_url=http://t.cn/Econconc""imagecard""1wk"""
"I can't stand it anymore, I'm depressed, I can't breathe, I'm afraid to go to work, I'm scared, I'm not sick, I'm really scared."
"Meals, when will you take me away? I've really lived enough to be scared, 24 hours, 1440 minutes, 864 seconds a day, but I haven't had a moment to breathe for myself. Unfinished debts, endless responsibilities, how much money can I make to fill a hole in the house. I really gave up, and I did my best, or I couldn't."
"I'm here again, and I can't stand it. I've fucked up every relationship for two days and I've always regretted why I do it, but every time I do it, I'm tired, I'm sleepy, I can't feel love, and life is really boring, right?"
"I've explained my weakness, and I don't want to say it, really, it's sad. I'm probably a fool, but why am I human? Why me? The world created me and laughed at me all the time, and I hate myself. Why am I not dead? They look at me sad, I'm ashamed. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"It's okay to think that you're okay, but it's all a problem, and it's my problem."
"I am unhappy today, I have no family and no food, and my mother has to eat in someone else's house to bring me back, and no one knows how sad I am at this time, as if I had been abandoned by the whole world."
It's all by itself &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hate myself & nbsp; &nbsp; & hate me more than yesterday
"I don't want to talk about it, but I want to be comforted."
I knew I had nothing to do with it.
"The first time I saw your tweet, I really wanted to know how you were there, and I wanted to get away from the world. I really, really, I don't want to be in pain anymore. I don't have anything, I don't have any family friends, I don't have none, I'm alone, I'm lonely, I really want to be hugged."
"Life isn't fun, you're tired, you're bored, you're bored, you're bored, you're out of business, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you're out of your mind, you know?"
"It's nothing, it's just that I'm struggling in the abyss of despair, but I'm tired of it, and even though he's been with me, why can't I ever escape the abyss of despair?"
"What's worse is that people look normal, only people who know what they're doing, who can't understand how desperate they are to try."
I'm so selfish. I wish someone could help me.
I'm the one who made my life this way.
"All those who loved me would leave me, not even a dog would like to be with me, a sad, sad man. Except for my father, who never dared to show his emotions, because he couldn't understand that I was not happy. Besides my mother, who couldn't control myself, a housewife started to understand depression. My father would have to die, and my mother would be sad. But I'm really tired..."
Would it be better if I cut it? Should I die when I'm so ugly?
"Solitude, so much solitude, so much interest in everything, and I have no incentive to move forward, and life can't stop me."
"I'm here again, I feel a little sweet yesterday, I feel bitter today, I feel sad without the sun, I feel sad, I want to run away, but where am I supposed to run?"
I'm so tired of living. Everybody's so hypocritical.
"Eat, arrange me an accident. I'm not going to last. Let me get out of it one last time. Let me get rid of this shame and feel guilty. I don't want to please anyone anymore. I'm so tired and tired. So let me get out of it if I can't change my character."
"Parents, classmates, colleagues, as if they've never met the right people, it's their problem."
"I think it's going to be a great game of mind games. Two poor people tweak together, none of them can believe it, and I'm a bit of a pain in the ass, and my insistence will soon be broken by a number of uncertainties."
"I don't like night, not at all. I hate that uncontrollable and filthy me. I'm not alone in the night and the day."
"Meals, maybe that's life. I envy it."
"Yeah, sometimes I wonder if it's my problem. I can't see in those things."
I'm not getting any better. I knew it. I didn't save my life.
"Rice, you see, no one likes anyone with negative energy around them. I have negative energy, and the world is not for me in the eyes of others. So I learn to laugh, play well, sometimes so brave that I can fool myself. For example, let's go to the sun today, and let's go to the sun again."
I hate it. I can't do anything.
"Most people actually have more or less self-inflicted self-inflicted. I sometimes feel bad, but I have to find my own way out, like listening to music and tearing off tears, as long as you're happy and you don't hurt yourself."
"It's my family, my feelings, it's a mess, it's hurt, and I'm still trying to live."
"You know, I just called the shrink and she asked me to do a set of tests, and after I sent her to see the results, the doctor advised me to go to the hospital to see if I might need some medicine and smile, and I know it's not good in my head, but I can't help but think, I'm tired, I'm depressed, I really have to hold on."
"I'm still hoping to find a safe haven for me on a living, so I can feel the love, if it doesn't matter, if it doesn't matter, if it doesn't matter, if it's not, no one will like me, especially when I'm in this state."
"It feels like it's broken. Unlike the people around it, it feels weird. It feels like it's different. The pain of the wound tells it's still alive, tells it's not easy, laughs at the Buddha's video."
"I'm tired of eating. I'm tired of typing. No hope, no motivation. I can't even feel the pain. I just want to get some sleep. Nobody knows my state. I don't even know why."
"The love of my life has done something to me, without saying goodbye. I don't know how the next life will be happy."
"I'm so sad, I'm so sad, but no one can listen to me, no one is worth sharing, I'm scared and cold, it's too hard to live."
I don't deserve to be lucky.
"It's not possible, it's possible, it's possible, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be..."
"It's raining so much, it's cold, it doesn't feel warm, I want to live, but it's too painful for me to feel alive."
But I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired.
"I went to the psych ward, hung up the anxiety clinic, checked out a moderate state of coercion, moderate symptoms of anxiety, severe symptoms of depression and moderate signs of hostility, severe fear and moderate paranoia. Today was the second day of diagnosis. It took me over two years to get the courage to get to that place."
You coward... you can't take a little pain. How can you kill yourself?
"I've been here all day with someone I like, but I woke up this morning and I started crying, and I cried in the afternoon, and he told me I had something to tell him, but I really can't."
I'm not doing well. You tell me. I'm sorry.
I'm here again. I'm not happy today. I've been crying since yesterday.
The world's not going to be all right.
No one cares anyway.
"I don't want to do anything, I want to sink, I want to fall, I want to fall, I want to fall, I want to fall, I want to die, I want to die."
"I'm numb, because some strange things don't laugh, and I don't know what it's like to be happy. The whole world doesn't want to do anything. Looking back is blank and there's no light in the future."
"I know it's a small thing to break up with us, but it must be a small thing to look back on, but I'm in a lot of pain right now."
"You know, I really don't want to live today, I'm really tired, I used to think it was hard for my mom, she always said I was dead and she was dead, so I was alive. But today I'm really tired, and he said I was pretending, and it wasn't, and if my grandma and my brother hadn't stopped me, that knife would have cut off my wrist. If my death could have ended it, I really would have."
"A couple of years ago, I thought I was fine, and it was getting worse and worse, and everything was going downhill, and when was the end?"
"After all, I've tasted the first evil of humanity, and when I've seen the worst nature of human beings, it's not too sad to experience the day of despair, and there's no good hope, and I just want to make myself happy now."
I don't know if it's too much to be afraid of someone who likes to be unhappy when he doesn't feel well.
"I've been depressed for a long time and I've wanted to die many times, until one day when I put a blade on my wrist but I don't have the courage to cut it down, and I don't want to live. But I'm afraid to die, I'm scared, I don't want to die, but I'm always tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I can't breathe, I can't even open my eyes, I can't wipe my eyes, I can't get my tears out like that. I'm really tired, I'm tired."
Nothing can be done.
"It's only today that I've learned about the “drinking” microblogging, as I can see. It's not easy for people who come here to comment. Me, too."
"I'm a terrible person, and every time I know someone, I end up leaving."
"It's sad that you're not in college, and you're being asked if you're at your age."
I'm their biggest obstacle to a happy life.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. I'll never be a qualified teacher.
"I know no one cares about me, but after all, I'm just an ugly duckling."
"I don't want to live, I'm afraid to die, and I can't stand it when you take me away from me."
"You're useless, rice."
"I can't do anything. There's no warmth. I'm sorry, I can't find the point of living."
"I want to go, I'm getting ready, I'm having a hard time living in the glass heart, I'm always sad about small things, I'm fed up, and I know there's a lot of good people in the world, but that class of us, it's disgusting."
"I envy you for your courage and feel like a chicken rat. She deleted me, and my mom thought I was a freak who talked about pre-divorce things so I could go to Dad myself. The teacher thinks I'm a liability, I'm about to graduate, I can't sign a job, the interview feels like I'm a negative person, my friends borrowed money to run away, and I still don't have the courage to stand up or have the courage to end it, and if I'm terminally ill, I can just leave."
"Everyone thinks I don't work, I'm dead, I don't want to see their power again..."
"Occasional insomnia can cause anxiety and headaches, and when I'm about to break out of control, I can't sleep in the morning and get caught up in negative emotions. Fearing that I can't make it, Mom and Dad are good to me now. What do they do, though they still have sisters and brothers. It's hard to live every day, the only friend can't understand me, he can't tell his family, I don't know why I'm like this, I'm too tired..."
"A man gives birth to a day of boredom, like a fool. And he eats a lot of messy things, and he calms the fire in my heart."
"If I'm depressed, then I think I'm saved, and the terrible thing is that if I'm not depressed, then I think I'm totally dead, and I don't dare go to the hospital, and I'm afraid the doctor will say that you're all right."
"I didn't think I was going to get better or worse. I was naive. The world is not worth it, and I am not worth it."
"I'm killing people or setting fire to make you so afraid of me, I know you don't care about me, I don't want to be with you anymore, why do you hurt me, and I mean it to you, but you, why do I have to get into this endless darkness when nothing happens, I know I'm vulnerable, I know I'm sweet, I know I have many flaws, but why do you hurt me, why?"
Last night we watched a late-night movie and kissed and held my hand for half an hour in front of my neighborhood.
"My father is a bit like Su, a little weak, but not as soft as Su. My mother is much softer than Zhao Meilan, he is hesitant to make his own decisions, and others refuse to make his own decisions."
"It's hard to get out on a bike with them yesterday, but it's not happy, it's like the world isn't about me, it's about the edge... it's so tired, you don't want to go out, you don't want to go out, you don't want to get a picture of it in a friend's circle..."
He refused his best friend's application. I'm so sorry. I'm so sad.
"My life is too lazy, too weak, too stubborn, to be too incompetent, too anxious to be able to take control of my future."
It's all because I'm asking myself too much.
"Part of my anger, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it, part of it."
"I like you, but you hate me."
Don't come in here. I really want to be alone.
"It was I who took the road this way, and some people in the world have dreams to work for it, and I am just living the day."
"I don't know what's going on around me, but I can't solve my problems. I feel like I can't get over it. I don't know what's going on."
"I don't want to go to Beijing. I don't like going to my aunt's house. I don't have a good relationship with my aunt. That's my stepmother. I don't like her very much. She's nice to me, but she's not my real mother. Still, I'm confused. My grandmother is old."
"It's been two years, and I'm here again, and I'm having a really bad time, and I want to go home when it doesn't seem like I'm really happy, and I want to hold my dog and put it in my arms, so I'll be so happy."
"I suddenly realized that, no matter how close I am to someone who's not depressed, who can never understand despair at the time of the attack, who can't find any reason to live, it's really bad that the whole world is so dark that he's been with me since he knew I had depression, but he wouldn't understand it. He said, ""Don't think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it if it's not, so I don't know how to talk about it."""
"Twelve hours a day, I can't sleep less than two or three in the morning, I sleep four or five hours a day, I can't be understood in my life, I can't get my heart out of a fight, I can cry, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep, I can't sleep."
I'm breaking up. I'm crying. I'm under a lot of stress.
"I have nothing to live for, no love for all of them, no soul for all of them. I'm sick. I can't control my thoughts, and so on, I just want to die, and I can think about what I was like when I died. I'm not in the future. I feel good, but it's not good to be alive."
"My grandfather was a civil servant, my grandmother was a great family member, and when my dad got married, he could have been fucked like everybody else."
"As a gypsy... if I get out of the closet, if I have to compromise, I'll do it for the rest of their lives, and I'll never find a boyfriend for myself... even if I can't find a girlfriend to kneel on my knees."
"It's good that you've got the courage, and I've got the pain between living and dying, and it's a painful process."
"I'm so self-righteous, I want to strangle myself."
Every night I want to die the next day.
"I'm like a quiet and beautiful hill, and I'm split up, and sometimes I want to have some powers, something to do, so that people can remember you, at least feel that you're there at two a.m. instead of being bored all day, so that every day I feel like a copy of a sticker, I feel like I'm there, I don't sleep at night, and I feel like I'm asleep, and I feel like I'm awake."
"I'm 25 years old, I'm 26 years old, I'm still without a boyfriend, my mom's worried that I won't get married, and I'm more and more guilty, and I feel sorry for them, and my life is a mess, and I want to close my eyes and never wake up again."
"There's always a feeling of incompetence, it's like someone's suddenly taking everything away. It's like no one understands me. It's hard."
"I never wanted to be redeemed, because no one would ever be redeemed. I've been responsible for all my sins since I was a child. It doesn't matter who's wrong or who's wrong. It's important that no one ever stands by me and says clearly, ""You're doing great, you're doing great, you're leaving the rest to me."""
"It's my birthday in 16 days, and I've been alone a couple of times, and this time I've planned to pass by by by myself, and I've been living to this point and I'm really tired, and I'm sorry that so many people in the world haven't lived around me for more than 20 years, filled with so much trouble, and I know I can't stand it anymore."
I don't have a future. It's like a beggar.
"I'm mesmerized, I smile at everyone, and I may start crying, and I feel like I don't have much hope of living. Parents' rejection and scolding, and the blame of their loved ones, I'm really crazy. The thing they say to me most often is that you listen to me, you're big, you're big, you understand your parents, you don't know anything. People can insist on why you can't. The Internet gives me a little comfort, thanks to the boy who's been with me."
Mom and Dad aren't working anymore. They don't know what they're thinking. They feel dark in the future.
It gets worse and worse because it makes bad decisions.
The world doesn't like me at all; I don't like it anymore.
"So when I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna suffer, I'm gonna suffer, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die."
"I still want... if there's a chance, I'm gonna rot in a corner. I don't need anybody."
It's like I'm the only one suffering.
"Yeah, just a little love, but if you grow up and you get a little love, you'll be abandoned, and maybe I shouldn't live in this world, and I don't deserve the happiness of a normal person."
"Parents just think about getting married, but they don't even want to live."
I was wrong.
Maybe it wasn't self-defeating. I guess that's what I am.
"She's still doing well, even though I've tried so hard to make her feel better, why is she always lucky and happy when she's done so many bad things?"
I'm like a piece of shit. I hate to see anybody.
"Silly, naive enough to borrow money from someone else and ask someone else to hit me, and I'll borrow it next time he's pathetic. No one says you're a good man, you're a good man, you don't have a brain, you're always trying to make yourself feel guilty and apologize for something bad, you want to be a bad person, but you want to be a good person. Ridiculous."
"I feel like I'm depressed, I envy you for being the person you like, no one in the world cares about how I feel, and I want to kill myself, but there's too much time for me to worry about."
"Always trying to save myself with a feeling, and finally finding out, tormenting people, hurting myself, maybe I'm not worthy of love."
"I'm tired of being emotionally tortured every day, and I can't live a normal life anymore, even taking a shower is a very tired thing, telling everyone around me that nobody believes me and thinks that I'm doing... that nobody understands... that it's so painful to be alive every day..."
"The day after the break-up, I accepted the fact of the break-up; & nbsp; but the mood continued to collapse and cried from time to time."
"When I eat, I come to you when I'm sad. More and more people feel that no one can understand my pain. No one really feels the same way. They may think that I'm not strong enough to feel responsible enough to come up with a hundred-year-old idea. I feel that living is so difficult that I can't control myself from being sad. I can't control my negative side."
I like someone. I just like it. Isn't it too weak to even talk?
I'm a sinner.
My mom must be having an anxiety disorder because her children are dying.
"I'm not trying hard... I don't want to do anything, I'm lazy and I'm afraid to die. You're really good at cooking, but maybe living is better."
"I've always wondered what it means to be alive. It's not funny. I'm such an empty person, I don't like anything, I don't have a lot of friends, I don't want to do anything, I live like a ghost. What does it mean to be alive?"
"I'm so tired, I can't sleep, I'm so desperate. Tears. It's useless for me to cry."
They're all big cabbage.
"Family, friendship, career, growing fear. Life isn't really what it is. It's about giving up."
Meals -- I don't know what I'm living for. It doesn't make sense. But I don't know how to do it better if my family's sad.
How could she hurt me like that?
I'm afraid that one day I'll really be gone... and I'm getting sick of myself.
Let's see what's worse. Come on.
"Who the fuck comes to save me, I'm really going to crash, it's too stressful."
"I'm a little happy today, but I'm afraid that happiness will never belong to me, and a little happiness behind it is endless darkness."
"I don't know what to say today, but people are really selfish, and now I'm afraid of the dark."
Why am I so corrupt?
"It's getting more and more sensitive, thinking that you don't care about failure, but it's hard to talk about it, and it's too hard to beat yourself, and it's too hard to be brave to feel like it's gone, and nobody can talk about it."
"My friend said he finally understood why you didn't come to the dorm because you were so protected, and I thought it was so good that I was protected, that my boyfriend was protected, that my family was broke, that my boyfriend betrayed me, that there was a financial problem with my family business, and they all came together and they oppressed me and forced me to cry for a change of character."
"I feel like I'm suffocating, staring at my eyes until dawn, even when I'm tired of tears. I wonder what we're living for, what's the point, what's the point, what's the pain, what's the point, what's the point, what's the need to survive?"
Why is it that I don't freak out when I'm being bullied? She's disgusting.
"Today's self, filled with resentment and anger, is not every day sad or angry, how am I supposed to get out of my head?"
"I can't, I can't. I'm probably a self-absorbed person."
No one really cares about me. I don't care if I die.
"My family doesn't want me to stay at home and eat old, too expensive, too afraid to see the future. If I get up tomorrow at 6:00 and I'm in this mood, then I'm going to die."
"A coward, a coward, a useless man."
"Now I'm really afraid to respond to people's feelings, and I feel like I've been trying to fail them and anyone. I remember when I graduated from college, I wanted to go outside, but I don't know why I stayed in the county, and I didn't have a life like I thought, and then I grew up in this life and I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I really needed a hug, and I needed a goal."
I can't get out of fear like a shadow. This suffocation makes me feel like I'm dying.
"I've always thought it was funny for someone who's lost his love, but now I'm really sad to leave him, and I've lost my last life-saving straw."
"My sister started watching TV early in the morning, and until now, she's jumping in the room, stomping on the floor, laughing with weird noises. It's so loud, it's so annoying. I want to kick her out."
I can't find my job. I'm a piece of shit.
It's like I'm waiting every day for an accident to die & nbsp; & nbsp; I don't know why everyone feels bad to me & nbsp; & nbsp; I'm everywhere redundant & nbsp; & nbsp; I'm day-days but happy & nbsp; & nbsp; I'm late at night and I want to cry & nbsp; & nbsp; I think it's really hard to be a person...
"It's too much to say, I've thought about it, and I'm going to go one day, and I can't bear it, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going, and I'm going to go, and I'm going, and I'm going to go, and I'm going to go, and I'm going, and I'm going to go, and I'm going, and I'm going, and I's going, and I's going, and I's going, and I's going to go, and I's going, and I's, and I's, and I's going, and I's going, and I's, and I's going to go, and I's, and I's going, and I's going, and I's, and I's, and I's, and I's, and I's, and I's, and I's, and I's,"
"When I got sick, I realized that I didn't have a friend."
"You're gone. I lose everything. You win, but what do I do? I'm alive for nothing."
"Every day, people feel like they don't want to live."
"What pig's hoof? Think about it, but you're not sleeping to hurt your body at this hour. Go to sleep."
"The only thing I feel guilty about is that I know that my parents spend so much on me, so much on her, and so much on my money, but there's so much I can't see, like in this house, that I can only sneak around and enjoy these spoils like a thief, and if we're sisters, I can do it right, but there's a lot less money to use, so it's all balanced."
"Next week, I'm gonna have to do it again. It's gonna cost me a quarter. I'm a loser."
"He's in a bad mood, he's suspicious of his boyfriend, he wants to break up, but he's not independent."
"Once again, there's always a negative feeling in the adult world. There's always anger at you. It's like no one cares about dying."
I shouldn't have come to this world.
"I don't care if the spring of April doesn't save me, standing under the sun, but I'm sorry I'd do better if I could do it again."
"I can laugh at even a little something funny, not because it's a little low, I just pretend to be happy, but I can't care about other people's thoughts, move around, feel alive for others, life has no meaning, want to be in the group, but every time I fail, I give up a man who talks to himself, who walks, who plays games."
I'm useless. Stupid people don't deserve to live easy. They're doing a lot of useless work.
"I've been asking for help many times since the beginning of my third year, 15 years, I've had you, I've had the light, but I'm not good, I've pushed my light away."
I hate this dirty world. I hate those dirty people.
"When I was in my teens and twenties, I started thinking of dying all day, and after 10 or 20 years of depression, almost 40 years of age, or when I met something I didn't want to face, I wanted to leave the world."
Sometimes I just want to cry like I used to. But I suddenly realized I didn't have any tears and I was numb. I thought of a doll and I couldn't feel it anymore.
"Either make me feel better, or I'll get an incurable disease, or I'll get a complete one."
"Unsatisfactory work, as well as the discomfort with colleagues, seems to have never been the same and eager to get together."
"It's raining out there today, and suddenly it's out of power, and my parents say they think I have personality defects, and they can't understand, and I'm gonna take someone else away from me, and I always like living in the past, and I can't pull myself out and torture myself. And I know that all the pressure comes from me, but in fact, I can't do anything about it, and I really hate myself."
"I feel like I'm useless, I'm losing my ID, I can't stand myself on the road, I'm walking and crying. I feel like I'm dying."
It's my fault I pick every day.
I can't say I'm really sorry. I'm really tired of living.
"I'm not good. When I chose to die, I put my parents and friends in the negative. I'm so sorry."
"I am a bipolar disorder patient who jumped out of the building and survived, spent money and energy on my loved ones, and I feel sad every day during the recovery period, feeling ashamed that I should not live, and that I should be blown to pieces."
"Today I'm being questioned by the people I like, and he's my little sun that gives me hope that every time it's my fault, and I don't want to explain it, it's raining again today, and I shouldn't expect someone to save me, and it's just someone else's burden, and I don't want to cry, and why I'm so weak, and I want to sneak out, but I don't dare."
"The memory's getting worse and worse, isn't it that one day no one remembers it?"
"But what you have to understand is that your parents can't be the perfect look you want them to be, and they won't change."
I envy your determination. I'm really tired. I want to die. I really want to die.
"I don't know why I'm crying, but I'm in a good mood today."
It's so lame. I don't want to live.
"If you could see my heart, you'd find that it's been a long time since life had scarred me."
Idealists like me don't deserve to live in this world.
I liked him better than yesterday; like poison; and & nbsp; & nbsp; addictive; & nbsp; & nbsp; I found I couldn't quit; &nbsp; & nbsp; am I too greedy of him; & nbsp; and suddenly I feel so tired of living my life?
"I feel like I'm being targeted again, but I really don't know how to be smart."
"I'm also waiting for someone like that, but I feel so miserable that no one should come near me."
I feel like I'm getting colder and colder; and there's a man next to the subway who didn't stand down on me; and & & & nbsp; & nbsp; I don't even have the time to pick up & & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & get her to stand up on her own.
Bullshit. I'm tired. I blame myself for it every day. I'm sick and sick.
My colleagues may think I'm depressed. I look weird.
I'd rather die now than fear every moment of tomorrow's emotional breakdown. I really can't stand it. I can't help it.
"I was in my room, and I heard my mom and my brother and sister laughing, and when I didn't wake up, I started to get upset. When I got into bed with dolls, I thought if I died, what would they do, they could burn clothes, they could send books, but these dolls have been with me for years, and if I died, they'd be in the garbage."
"I've lived in the dark for years, but I don't want the sun anymore. I'm afraid when I can reach the sun, I'm afraid I'll lose the sun and go back to darkness. It's harder than I've ever had it."
"One day I don't eat, I'm not hungry, I don't want to eat, I hope I can die in bed tonight, and I don't have to wake up. I leave a farewell letter on my cell phone so I can ease their pain in case I leave suddenly. I'm happy. Of course, I still hope I don't wake up."
I can't remember. I can't remember. I can't remember.
I don't deserve good luck.
"But she doesn't know how I've been here all these years. Junior high school knew that I really hated myself, thought I was dirty, and really... it's permanent and it's gonna hurt twice. I feel like I'm going crazy. It's too bad."
"I'm ashamed of myself, too. I really am. I wish I didn't have good people in my world."
"My new year's wish for a birthday in the last two years has been to wish for the health of my family and friends, but this year my uncle left, so the wish cannot be fulfilled at all. I'm a 26-year-old adult. I still believe in it like a child."
I don't know how many times I've collapsed this year. Maybe I shouldn't have existed.
"I've stopped taking pills, I've had a complete breakdown, I'm really tired. Why can't I die?"
"I want to live, but why do I have to force the people I love? Again and again, I really don't know what to do. If there's not a lot of things to do, I hope I can just sleep and not wake up again. Take me away. They won't bother me if I'm gone."
I hate myself so much that I can't change myself. Is it because I'm lonely?
"Yeah, well, what's the point of insisting? It's all suffering anyway."
"I can't talk to people because I can't work, and I can't talk to people."
"I don't want to talk to anyone who says I'm sick, I'm sick, I don't want to meet someone I know, I don't want to call back, I don't want to. I'm trying to pretend I'm optimistic and positive, I'm really trying, but I can't stop thinking about it."
"Meals, you know, I've been sick of myself for a long time. I've been sick of myself for a long time. I'm sick of seeing myself. But I can only feel like I'm real in this. It's sad."
Who called me poor?
But I'm just stupid.
They're the ones who think like that.
I've got to get better or I've got to get better or I've got to get better and worse.
"There's no such person, he/she leaves and makes you feel like your soul has lost a piece of it... it's not time to make up... it's not time... it's time to go back, it's time to find this... it's time to go back, it's time to find it, it's time to find it, it's time to find it, it's time to find it, it's time to find it, it's time to find it, it's time to find it, it's time to find it, it's time to die, it's time to die..."
"All I dare say in my comments is that I'm depressed, but I don't dare. I think I'm a weak, lonely patient."
"Depressiveness is a disease of the poor, with daily mechanical work, family chores and sudden malice."
"I'm so tired, I'm so tired, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of watching the sun, I'm so tired I can't wake up and sleep and sleep for the rest of my life..."
"I'm sorry, I'm very humble. I'll leave the world when I don't want to."
It's all because of me.
My existence is wrong.
How do you want me to live?
"Why is it always you? They always say you're nothing. Yeah, it's all my straw."
I'm so sad. I want to die for nothing.
"But who can come to me with nothing but energy, bad temper, black and thin and ugly?"
"You think you're useless, but you're not going to suffer when you're dead."
Should I choose to trust? How should I trust? Is that too much to think of? Why can I be so cruel? What am I?
"Some girls are disgusting, they're making videos for a man to abuse other girls. Shouldn't they be thanked for the evidence they gave to the police? I have to talk to her about it, but I don't think she's going to call the police because of subsequent retaliation."
"Suddenly happy, suddenly sad, like a psycho, I just want to get beaten, and I can be beaten to death."

"I hope we all get out of the vortex of emotion faster, faster, and I don't want to be able to face life more positively than yesterday. I'm really anxious, and I'm going to go on a training trip and pack my bags, and I'm going to get nervous."
"I'm starting to get a breakdown in time, but I'm not tired, I'm not tired, I don't have a lot of hard work, but I hope I'll have the courage to end it."
"I thought I could drop my attention on you, but I still can't. How was it with you? Isn't it so easy? I envy you, but I'm too scared to walk away. How I wish I didn't have ears, so I wouldn't be so disappointed in the world, I wanted to come to you, you must wait for me!"
There's no love in the world.
The bad news of today is over. The rest is good.
Nobody wants me anymore. They threw me away.
Let's go. I feel sorry for myself. I'm dying.
"Life doesn't stop when you're happy, when you find something to live, and there's a lot of things to go on and on. I don't want to cry. But I feel like it's happening again. Once you hit your ears, you don't even get your hands back. Why is it so painful?"
"2019, still a humble one."
9 April 2019 & nbsp; & nbsp; it's a long night and it's gone.
"I don't like working parents, I don't like it! I'm going! I don't want to stick to my own path. I don't want to stick to the same thing for a long time. I don't know how many times, I'm tired, I'm tired early. I'm dying. I've met so many interesting people, I'm a little tired, but I'm tired, I'm confused, I don't know what to do."
It's not important to be alive.
Meals & nbsp; & nbsp; I always want to die & nbsp; & nbsp ; I'm really tired
"In fact, I'm particularly weak. All I'm thinking about is running away."
"In fact, it's life, it's forcing you, hoping that others will get away with it, and I've been having troubles lately."
"Crying in the morning till afternoon, my eyes still hurt. I'd love to find hope, but life is full of pits."
"Yeah, well, it's not like a girl who doesn't even meet her friend's head, and I'm not sure she'll ever be offended by someone who's specially mature. It's not like she's in front of a family or a relative. It's all wrong not to know what she can't do without justice. It's really boring."
Why am I so fat and ugly?
The warm sun will never come again.
"No, I don't think a man's words can be trusted. Don't be so humble next time."
"I feel so stressed, I don't know what to do next, I can't see hope at work. I can't see the future."
"Watching your microblogging makes you cry. I envy you. You can say your unhappiness like a joke. Then I have the courage. I'd really like to meet you if you were still there. It's a long time ago. And I really can't understand why I'm not happy. I'm okay with people living in a family like this, and it's really hard for me."
I'm so tired. I'm so tired of living.
I'm such a bitch.
"I've been thinking about the pains of my heart so far, even though the world hasn't been nice to me for so long, and I see it doesn't like me, and I can't help it, and I'm holding on to my insecure heart, and I'm just laughing to cover up my wound."
"It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it cries, and I've got tears to cry, but I don't have the courage to call the police and kill that heartless man."
"The thought of the future is endless despair, and it's hard to live."
"I'm just really sorry about some people, but I'm sorry enough for myself."
"The world doesn't like me at all, and I don't like it anymore."
"I'm tired, but I'm afraid to die, and my dad's pointing out who's bad for you today, and he's under a lot of pressure, and now he can't even drive, he's always afraid he'll run into someone else, and he hasn't had more fun in a long time."
"Even if I were sick, I wouldn't let anyone know I was sick or I was sick. That's the mystery of the legend."
"As we all know, nothing lasts forever."
It's nice to have a laugh next door. I'm going to be so lonely for the rest of my life.
"I'm so open-minded, I don't think there's any point in living."
You can't be happy when you're in love without depression.
"You're tired, you're full of bad news. You've been dead all these years."
"I can't find a way out of this. I've done well from the top ten schools across the country to the top ten schools in the world. One year of antidepressants has stopped, a high-paying job has been found, but I can't hold on to it."
It's too hard to be left out by everyone.
When are these days going to end? Are you really going to kill me?
"A man like me, nobsp; nobsp; that sucks."
It's like no one's ever considered my feelings.
"I'm here again for dinner, and you know I'm particularly sad today, like I'm going to crush me with a little bit of small stuff, but I'm thinking I'm a good team player every year, and this year I'm the press commissioner who wrote a lot of press releases and took a lot of pictures of the class, and I'm in the middle of it. In fact, I don't have a vote, and I don't have a girl who doesn't usually have a thing, but who calls people to play games, and what's the point of my existence?"
"I despair, and I am tired, and I do not believe in humanity, nor am I happy. full of pain. And what is there to live for?"
"I feel like a schizophrenic, like a freak, like a lunatic, and I'm trying to suppress my pessimistic feelings and ideas, and I'm trying to make myself look as if I'm in love."
You just don't like me. I don't like me.
"I'm fine. I'm happy to love you. He's so good, but I'm so tired."
May I die early. You're such a bad-ass man. You're wasting your air.
I feel like I'm useless.
"Sometimes it's hard not to think of myself as having a little cold water on my own, and maybe they think it's good for me and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but why they don't care about me &nbsp; &nbsp; ask my thoughts & nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; & don't hit & nbsp if you don't support & & nbsp; &nbsp; & nbsp; my life doesn't want to be made clear by them & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & maybe they're right to put my way steady & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & & I'm personal & nbsp; & & nbsp; have my own thoughts & want to be happy; & nbsp;"
"I'm really tired, and I'm never going to go to a hospital and review it again."
"Well, I'm really useless because I can't keep up with my feelings, and I hate depression, but what if he doesn't go away?"
Weak.
I may not be able to survive this spring. I should not be able to live this summer.
"I've had so much pain in my life, I can't forgive it, I can't hate it."
I have nothing to do with all the good things in the world.
Why isn't anyone treating me well?
"I'd love to have someone to help me get out of this dark abyss. But, no, no, no, no, no, no. I've always been the only one who could save myself, but it's hard to save myself. There is no one who can count on me. Better friends don't want them to touch the darkness of my heart. I'm not afraid of being alone, but I'm afraid of being alone."
"It's easy to drive when there's no way out. I'm much better. I'm going to do what I like. I'm going to do what I like. I'm going to do what I like. I don't care about people's eyes. When I'm old, I'm going to travel, a car, a car, a sight, and, finally, find a quiet place, and that's it, a salt fish, a free salt fish."
"Every morning at school like a normal person, laughing, I almost thought that I was getting better, but I had a breakdown in the evening, and for no reason, it was painful."
"I'm so ugly, I really don't deserve it. I'm uglier than anyone else, dumber than anyone else. I really don't deserve it."
"Don't be like that, sister, I've been having a lot of depression and social phobia for 20 years because of my personality, and I've been at home for a year and I've been afraid to go out and talk to people every day like a walker, and I'm a living person. I'm going to go to the hospital this year. Do you think there's really no room for you in this world? Let's work together."
"I never thought my second sister would do this to me, and I couldn't find someone to talk to, and I thought I was useless, and I had no place to go, and it wasn't the best thing that ever happened to me?"
"Sometimes the cells in the head move, they get tired."
Maybe death is the only leverage I can fight fate.
"I'm sorry to meet you late, but it's not too late to get to know you, but I always feel like I've been crying for a while, crying like I can't do anything, and anyone's better than me. But now that I'm about to graduate, I'm getting old and hoping that my little buddy here will find his own happiness and happiness, even if he doesn't forget to be with someone."
"It's time to go to bed, to eat, to sleep, to not talk to you today, to sleep, but I can't cry."
Why live if you can't make yourself happy?
"Life is happy, but life is hopeless. I wish I'd never been in this world. I always screw everything up."
"I feel like I'm living in a painful abyss every day, trying to pull myself out, but it gets deeper every day."
I pray that God will take my life now. I can't jump out of school. I'm not wrong at school. I'm not wrong at school. I'm not wrong at school.
"Too eager to own, sometimes to others, is a burden on themselves, for example, to live."
Have you lived in another world? Have you understood? Take me with you. There is nothing left for me in this world! Dead! Desperate!
"I wake up feeling that everything in the world means nothing to me. I don't want to talk, I don't want to sleep, I don't want to do anything."
He's still alive. Why should you suffer what he deserves?
"I've been trying to control my emotions, but I really hate myself, and I'm trying to make life better, but it doesn't seem to make any sense."
"Life's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
"One's life is not easy, I've been mixed up for 41 years, I've had the toughest days of my life, and now I'm just thinking about it, and I'm just thinking about it, and I'm afraid of death, and I'm just trying to find an excuse for myself to be happy. Of course, everyone's sufferings are different. They're not trying to convince you. Just think of the fact that it's easy to get rid of hundreds of millions of brothers in October."
I'm a liability to live.
"They always try to find out if the world is wrong and not their own. But they can't find themselves. They don't know enough about themselves, drag their legs. They don't know enough to play. They're sprayed. They don't read enough."
I'm so tired of crying all night.
"Well, that's why people like me deserve to be rejected."
"I'd like someone to warm up, but my possessiveness will make it look bad, and no one will accept me as bad as I am, if only there was another in the world."
"It's not really his fault, it's my own incompetence."
"I can't stand it anymore, and it's another year, and I remember him again, and he can take me away?"
I don't have the ability to work; & nbsp; I'm nothing; & nbsp; I'm nothing; & nbsp; I have a lot of difficulties and obstacles.
"I don't know where to get a sleeping pill. I feel like I'm dying. It's a happy thing. If I could die, I'd be happy."
"I don't know what I'm going to die for, but it's just hard to die."
"You know I can't stand it anymore, and I want to see you."
Today we're all sand eagles.
Maybe I shouldn't even be in this world.
I've finally become the kind of person I hate.
But nothing's gonna get better.
"I've lost someone like that, and I'm comforting people."
"I'm afraid of death, but I don't deserve to live."
"The doctor's medicine makes me feel strange, but taking it makes me feel funny, like a little robot."
"My dad's out there cursing again, and I'm listening to this giggle in my room, living every day in fear and despair, living with a psycho, and he's killing me and ruining my whole life."
"There's parents around, and there's nothing left to love, so forget it, survive or destroy, and you have no choice."
I don't have friends or boyfriends or people who really like me.
"Hey, dinner, it's been a couple of days, it's really not happy, it's emotional. Work. Life's a mess. My stomach starts to get upset when I think of something else to deal with. I'd love to fill it with something. Suffocated, and then I'd be less empty."
It's childish. It's disgusting.
"I'm not so bad and cute, I'm not just happy for what I live for. I don't care if you're dirty."
Your life will be over soon.
"Every time I go out, it's like people all over the world are watching me look at my flaws."
"On the third day of the hospital, negative ideas can control things that don't come out for no reason, but I'm still tired of being alive, and I don't even want to cure my illness, and I can't die when it's done."
I feel like I'm sick everywhere.
It's sick.
It's hard to feel for a while. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; good only means that I'm weak.
"I woke up, I woke up, I slept, I was struggling between dreams and reality, and I opened my eyes, and my head was suddenly pulled back from my dreams."
I'm too fragile to use the only chip.
"I want to hug, but I push this hug once and for all for fear of being hurt again, and now I have nothing but a life that's not worth it, and I want to end it, and I want to put an end to everything, and when I haven't been in this world, I can't find anything!"
"No one wants to fall in love with a depressed person, right?"
"I was also a lively child, infecting his friends with positive energy, actively entering without fear of failure. I did not know when to begin, and suddenly I did not like to speak, to be alone, to be afraid of trying, to be weak, to be humble, to be incompetent."
That's why you can't be completely happy with depression.
I don't like life either. I always wonder when I'm going to end up there.
"There's so much I want to do, but there's nothing I can do."
You're a liar.
I've really become a very bad person. I'm so sorry.
"I missed the time to sign up, I couldn't take the exam, and I didn't tell anyone because I was already in pain, and if I told someone I'd be blamed again, it would be worse. You can understand me, you can eat."
"Why do you get depressed? I know, I deserve to die."
"Hey, stranger, it's because I'm upset and my husband's asking me to divorce, and it's not like I won't let him go for better happiness, but I'm tired of this disease, trying to walk alone in peace and without knowing how to leave without pain, to admire your courage when I take the knife, it's cold when I'm standing up there, and I think it's a big wind, and it's a reason for fear."
"I feel like I'm living on my own, and my contradictions are about to explode, and I miss you so much."
"At noon, even though I'm crying, I can't hold on for a few hours, and I don't know when my parents will be left alone, and then accidentally have my baby, get through a tough pregnancy, and then come to my baby, but no one loves her, except me. She's my angel, saved me, but I'm not a good mother."
"I work here so hard, relationships never work out. It must be my problem. I'm too proud to be a licking dog to smile."
"Be careful, then rely on it, then believe it all, give it to you, until this is the end of our lives, and your success will never make me like and love again, and your success will wipe out my ability to kill me."
"The book says you can be the most confident and happy you can be, but I don't dare."
Maybe I'm redundant.
"I've been so scared of being alone lately, I'm afraid I'll die and nobody will know. It's like I'm a friend. I feel like I'm a failure."
"It's been a while. It's my problem. I'm sorry, friends."
No one likes me. No one cares about my mood. Am I completely gone?
"And then all my pain turned out to be what she said to me. But everyone ignored me and talked happily when I went mad. My life was just a shame, and I heard someone laugh more."
"I don't want to have anything to do with my mother, but I'm in too much pain and I have to hang around. Otherwise, I can't help what I'm learning. I'm scratching out, I'm empty, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't."
"I want to go. I want to go 24 hours a day, I want to give up. I really can't."
"I'm sorry, but the world may have given me bad feedback."
"I want to die, to do the work I don't like, and my parents keep pushing for girlfriends, and these days I've been depressed, watching the flower world get less fun and it's like jumping off the balcony."
"I'm starting again, this intermittent depression, it's killing me, I'm reading books today, I can't find places when I'm closed, I can't find them, you know, I can't find them, and I'm starting to cry on the way to the subway station, and it doesn't seem like I'm alive."
"All of a sudden, it is so sad that, because of illness, the daily amount of medicine is enough to eat a meal, and from time to time there is a check. Without me, there would have been no such burden, and their lives would have been better."
"I'm a graduate in Chinese medicine, and after many years of graduate studies, I'm only a graduate student, and I'm taking too many blows this year, and I'm a hard-working man, and it took me a lot of time to pull myself out of a low mood, but I really don't have the confidence. I really envy your graduate students, because they're more competitive than undergraduates, and they don't even have the qualifications to sign up."
"Meals, maybe I'm evil, so I never get what I want. The world is hell for me."
I'm a machine with no feelings. I have nothing to lose.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; knowing it's wrong & nbsp; &nbsp; but can't control myself & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; and don't know when to hold on
"I don't think it's good to do anything, even when it looks like it's good enough for someone else to blame themselves, because it's bad for themselves, because none of my friends know about depression, and they really think it's too much for me, but I'm really sorry to let myself die."
"You think it's sweet, but it's bitter, and it's bitter, and it's bitter, and it's bitter."
"Every time life and work get bad, I want to see what you're talking about, it's getting better and better, it's bullshit! For me, it's good to be able to stay the way you are, and, more importantly, you never know what's worse, a mountain is lower than a mountain, and a low is never lower."
I'm just a parasite.
"What is it now? Probably, eating and dying in constant despair."
"Last week I was so sad, and I set a suicide date for myself, and then I went through it every day. Today is my birthday and I set a suicide date!"
"Self-confidence makes me extremely insecure, and I have to look confident again in front of people. & nbsp; & nbsp; so I dare to live with my feelings of inferiority and security only every night, when I am in a nest. Sometimes I can only sleep by the corner of the wall or by the bedboard. & nbsp; & nbsp; before I was afraid to die in my room for months, there was no one to find out, and now there is an accident in my bed."
I can't live. I can't do anything right.
It turns out there are so many similar people. Not since 8:00 a.m. woke up. Hungry but not remembering. I just want to cry. I don't want to cry. I don't know what I can do every day at this age. I don't know what I can do when I quit. I don't know.
Maybe it won't last forever.
I'm such a pain in the ass.
I'm not good at all. I'm not good at all.
"See, I'm crying again. It's useless."
"You take a cab back to school at night, go through a dark road with only a couple of street lights, you can't be scared, you can't think of any kind of car accident kidnapping, what if you die, and then you think that the suicide note is written, and you're calm."
"He made me quit and forced me to give up everything, like I never had a choice, a puppet, so tired I wanted to talk to my parents, but they never gave me a chance."
"I found out that I was gay. I'm sorry for my family, I'm sorry for my friends. I can't admit I'm not being kind, and my friends are leaving me."
"I'm going to see a psychiatrist tomorrow, and I feel like I'm not gonna get better. I'm going to buy a red dress, I'm going to light a warm fire, I'm going to drink sour and sweet wine, I'm going to make myself a beautiful make-up, and I'm going to leave quietly and with dignity."
"I'm really sorry, but at this point in time, I can kill a camel like a straw if I don't see it."
"Sometimes I feel really tired, I don't know why I'm so tired, I don't have a job, I don't know how to go, I really want to kill myself."
"The meal, the third day of the break-up, yesterday's day is over, and I wish I could sleep well, but the feeling of what's crushing comes back, envious of those who can sleep well."
There's nothing to be happy about. It's too much of a day's work. I've given up.
"I'm really crazy and I can't go out in my own world. I can't help it. If it wasn't for my only child, I'm afraid..."
What if you can't find a job in six months?
"I don't think I should really get married. Marriage is more painful and more painful. You can't imagine what funny things have happened to me since the 14th of the month. My parents treat me, and the husband I choose to do. I wonder how miserable things are. I might have children, and my childhood is sad, and I don't want my children to suffer."
"Meals, I'm taking too many days off, and the teacher says I'm gonna have to fix it again. I'm only looking forward to the poor two days of vacation, and I'm gonna make it to the point where I'm tired and disgusted."
It's so lonely. No one in the world will understand me.
"It's boring to finish class in the morning, and it's all about that old-fashioned, obsessive teacher."
"One bad news after another, and two years of having another girlfriend, the new favorites I've met and his ex are back together, and it's been so hard to get half of the 2019s, it's like copying the 2018s, it's disgusting."
"I've got a lot of ways to prove that I'm not bad or that I'm not bad, but it's true to make that girl cry."
Maybe the sparkling ones don't belong to me.
"I don’t know if I'm mentally ill, I'm always losing my temper, I can’t move, I can’t do anything. The relationship with my parents is bad, and I don’t know what I'm worth."
"I think it's hard to be alone abroad, and because of this shit, I can't stay with Grandma when she needs me the most, and I hate myself, and she's been gone for almost a year. Mom says it's gonna be okay, but I know I won't, and I'm gonna lose my grandma forever, and no one can cure me."
"You can't have a good life, you can't have a good death."
"I'm probably going to be like this for the rest of my life, and it's going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it's going to be fun when I'm dead."
"I don't think there's a guy in the world who really likes me. Even if he likes it, he's gone for a long time. There's a chance. Now, I really understand."
"It's depressing, it's helpless, it looks like it's depressed, it's working, it's hard to live, it's hard to live, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
"I don't want to wake up, I just want to sleep forever, just one wish to finish. It's done, I'm gone. My life's gone. Wait for me. We'll talk."
I feel like I'm going to have to get a little bit of it.
Remembering the previous laser surgery in 2014 & nbsp; & nbsp; reminiscent of the first day of the school's day off from Pearl Coasters to take five license plates from the kindergarten of a factory worker to meet him on a walk-by basis until he ends up grieving & nbsp; & nbsp; almost one cry every day for thousands of days. When can we die? & nbsp; & nbsp; eyes are almost lost.
Living for me is torture. It's torture for others.
It's gonna be a very hard day. I'm tired. I'm tired.
I'm so tired. I'm so tired.
"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
"All the hypocritical love or people are away from me, or they can't get close to me."
Let me be a villain.
No one would really like me.
I'm going to work overtime on the day after the day off; & & nbsp; it's so painful
"If I kill myself, a lot of people will laugh at me."
"In February, when I had a breakdown of my emotions because of the poor performance of my studies to the point of doubting that I was really depressed, I had one experience of the world collapsing, and this time I had a run-off similar to the previous one, and I added a couple of depression patients and looked at their conversation in the group, and I found myself suddenly happy when I wasn't like them, because I wasn't depressed, and I was just occasionally depressed, and I could be cured."
I'll never be able to wait for someone who really loves me.
No more waiting. No one's gonna give you a hand.
"I hate people in this world, things, everything, including myself, I want to die, I really want to die..."
What's wrong with me these days?
There are plenty of bad guys with two legs in the world.
I don't like myself right now; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I find &nbsp; &nbsp; I can sit on my phone for so long; &nbsp; &nbsp; I like you better than yesterday; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm sorry I didn't meet the best of myself; & nbsp; & nbsp; I wish the next life was gone.
"Well, I actually know what people think of me walking down the street, but I can't stand my parents saying that."
"It's been a long time since I've been here, and it's useless to see how I try to make myself normal, how I try to be stable, how I can't, how I can't, how I can't, how I can't, how I can't, how I can't, what I've seen in my dreams, how I've come, how I'm crying, how I can't stand myself."
"Sometimes I just lock myself in my room, turn off the lights, close the curtains, keep the darkness with me, and I'm all alone in the room crying, and I'm depressed to the point where I don't know why I like it."
I'm meant to be alone for the rest of my life.
I'm not worth it.
"I'm afraid I'm not depressed, there's no reason to cry. I'm weak, but nobody knows, I don't like talking to strangers, nobody knows, they'll say I'm weak."
He's a depressed patient. No one loves or dares to love.
No one else likes me either.
I'm so useless and ugly.
"Maybe a depressed person like me shouldn't be in contact with this particular group. I thought his sun and his confidence would get me out of the dark, but I didn't think he was bringing me more pain. People change."
"I'm so dependent on her, not just on her, but on everyone around me."
"Why should I wake up, not having any emotions when I'm asleep, when I'm happy, when I wake up, and I'm not happy? Why wake up, when I'm dead, I'll never wake up."
I've been trained again today. I'm really tired and I'm falling apart.
"It's like I'm looking at life with a magnifying glass, and all my suffering is magnified, and my little joy is not felt, and even after a little happiness, it's an endless loss..."
Nobody cares about me.
"I've already forgotten what a loathsome person looks like, and I've been reading the albums, and I've been in my head, and I'm really sick, and why I met you, and I've met her, and please let me go, and I just want to laugh every day, and I'm healthy and healthy."
I really feel like shit.
I can't stand it. The most disgusting is my family. Maybe it's not family? I don't even want to leave them dead.
"I hate a man, I hate trying to beat her, and it's already been a pain in my life."
I don't think so. I can't be with anyone else.
"Today, it is particularly distressing to see others live an active life. Every day I fall, want to be strong, but I can't feel anything. I can't even read my favorite novels. Once I fail, I now turn my back on myself. I can't stop thinking about my parents. I feel sorry for them. Every day I suffer and suffer."
I don't fit in with the world. I'm like an outsider.
"There's never been any in-house communication between our family, and even if I wanted to say, my mom moved on, so maybe she really doesn't want to talk about it."
How could I be so sad?
"You know, making friends is just flirting. I'm such a bad guy who likes it."
"I'm sorry, I've just arrived in Shanghai, it's hard to find a job, I'm family, I can't find a suitable job, I'm really going to crash, I'm afraid I won't make it."
"I want to tell people that I'm sorry, but they won't understand me. My heartache is my own. I don't know how I feel. I love what I like, but when I put it down, I'm in a bad mood."
The world won't be so sad.
"Alcohol is a temporary relief from anxiety, but it's still there the next day waiting for you, with a hangover reaction."
I'm jealous to see who's dead in the movie news. I don't have to live anymore. It's great. I'll never be in this world again in my next life. I wonder why.
I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything.
I'm sick of myself. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it.
I was thinking that my mother thought that my existence was the most important factor in my illness.
"Life is really a gamble, and losing is a tragedy, and winning is a comedy."
"I had dinner with him, the restaurant that we celebrated on the day of our wedding certificate. After a month, the letter was finally written and I could go."
I can't see the future.
They say I'm infatuated; & nbsp; & nbsp; I'm incompetent & nbsp; & nbsp; it sucks
People like me shouldn't be alive.
I don't have what I buy or what I don't have.
"Meals, I think I'm dead, I can't stand it, why I'm wrong. I don't have anything to live with."
"When the rice and the black dog didn't bite me, I thought I was a normal person, and I was delusional, and it was easy to knock me down, bite me and laugh at me. I was having fun playing games with my old friend, and I cried two or three times at night. Covered, I was wondering if I could suffocate to death with a blanket and put on my headphones, and I was wondering if I could kill myself with my headphones, and I stuck my headphones around my neck, and then I cried, and why I cried."
Everything's so bad.
Cold and hungry; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #bsp; #bbsp; #bsp; &nbsp; I'm afraid they'll come down and see me asking questions again; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & & & nbsp; & & & & & nbsp; I have to think that every day I'm dying.
"Sitting and crying, standing and crying, lying and crying, eating and crying, watching TV and crying, always crying."
"In 2018, I knew I couldn't get him back, and I went to another city to see a lot of scenery, and I thought I could still be happy, but when the night came, I was still crying, crying for hours, and then I ate something wrong, and the food was poisoned to the hospital."
"I want to hide in a place where there's no one else, where you left me when you were the worst, and that's never gonna happen again."
"He's crazy, he's dead, he doesn't hurt. Let's go down there and show our friends the way."
"Take me with you. It's so sad, it's so crashing, it's so hard."
Why are you still alive today?
"I've got a lot of problems I want to talk to you about, but what am I supposed to do?"
Life won't get better.
"I'm worried about the bus, and I'm worried about the morning."
"Some people love, some people care, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Feels like a feiwu is okay.
I'm such a coward.
"And there's a comment: I just want to be loved. But, I want to be loved, to be honest, to be honest, to be honest, to be treated like a pastime, when I'm too good to be bullied. But I'm still being bullied. It's no fun, life."
"It's not worth it, you're not worth it."
"I've done nothing or even tried to kill myself, but it didn't work out, hip-hop, my stomach pains are getting worse and my depression is getting worse, but I don't want to treat it, and I'm prepared to face death, but I don't have the courage to look at my life, and maybe it's being laughed at."
"I just can't be more dependent on people. It's useless. Maybe the brother doesn't want to talk to me. Maybe he's just being polite. After all, I'm just a stranger."
"I'm so tired. I promised her I wouldn't have this idea again, but she didn't know what it would be like if she and the other guys were eating hotpots in her room for two hours. I'm so tired. But I'm glad you're happy."
It's a canon. It's never gonna get over it.
"He's having a good time. He's a nice girl. She's a nice girl. He's getting happy. It's great. I really don't miss him at all, but I'm happy to meet a nice girl. I'm still listening to my dark night, and I'm more and more fond of it, and I'm more and more addicted to it. That hidden pain is proof that I'm still alive, isn't it?"
"You know, I envy you, and I'd love to leave the world. But I'm afraid that my parents will be left unattended, and I'm afraid that my parents will be sad, and it's too good if Harry Potterley, like Emma Watson, would be able to erase their memories and everything about their children. I really can't live. I really want a car accident or an accident to take me away. My parents have to live a long and healthy life."
"It's bad to know you're not good, but it's bad, but, yeah, every time you say you want to die, the tears come out. I just hope it's a little love, and it's-- it's a little fatty who's not lucky, and it's the world that looks so good. It's the kindest thing you can do. It's a little happiness. I'm not greedy. It's just a little."
"I can't expect anyone to be comforted, not to be a reason to be happy, not to be able to face life, not to talk, not to find out I'm not good, not to care, even though I want to be remembered, to be valued, to be held in my heart, never to have it, so it's more precious."
"It's not selfish to leave the question of life or death to you. I can't take any responsibility. How can you do it for me? I've always hated it. Yes, I am."
"I have no love, no one loves me."
Tomorrow the sun will still rise & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; humble and small is insignificant in front of all & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; not in the right way & nbsp; & nbsp; the wrong me
"It doesn't feel any better to take a year's medication, like tearing up the east wall and fixing the west wall for a period of time, and maybe the disease can't be cured."
"Every second I live in pain and despair to say goodbye to the world, but every day I keep on living, I've tried to talk to you, but I've been mocked."
"Me and my boyfriend let go, I'm a strong and easy-to-be man, and he's, on the contrary, every time I say something, he forgets it, and then I get angry too many times, and I feel like I'm not me, and I don't want to get mad at a puppet."
Why am I always unhappy? I'm sorry you're going to get along with me like this. I'm sorry I lost the one you used to know.
"So many people still remember her, and now Nanjing's got a lot of subways, but it's still crowded, so if you're still alive, you don't like it."
"I'm a piece of shit and a liability. Being alive is tied up and bound. If my parents hadn't brought me to this world, they'd already have a son."
"There's nothing worth living for, but death can't end it all... and I know that everyone's got a lot to do, but I'm a scoundrel who can't move on."
"It's not because I'm afraid of dying, it's because I can't bear to have my family kneeling for so long after I die, and there's always one selfish, one selfless, and they probably don't know how tired and sad I am, and they say I'm just sick, and I don't want to admit it."
"When I pretended to be a liar, people said I was a liar. I was rich, and everyone thought I was a big man. I was cold, and everyone said I was a heartless man. And yet, when I was in pain and I couldn't stop moaning, everyone thought I was sick and moaning."
"I don't know how long I can last, no roads, no eyes at night. Last time, it took almost eight years to improve, and then only two years to get better and fall to the bottom. I'm always told how hard I try, and no one can really see, and when I write these words, I cry, my eyes are swollen, and I can still see them with eyes and covers."
Why is it so selfish and stupid that you're sick of yourself?
Nobody cares if I'm happy. Nobody knows.
Men are big hoofs!
"When I'm in a bad mood, I like to play games. I can give up anything but games. After the game, the whole world is numb, probably lonely."
"In fact, I'm really open, and I'm really dark inside... and I'm always thinking about how to destroy a good relationship... and whether people like me or not, and whether I'm a bad person behind my back, or if everyone's pretending to be friends with me... and I'm really upset that I don't know what I'm thinking."
Life has no meaning.
"Just protect me, okay?"
Living with pain will cost you dearly to find the meaning of living.
"I don't know why I'm alive, so I want to die."
"Mom and Dad didn't even take me to the hospital for six months, didn't get better, their arms were full of scars, and I wasn't ready to live last night, but I overestimated myself, and I cried, and I couldn't pretend that nothing had happened, and I survived, even crying and shaking, and I was really afraid people would whisper about me behind my back."
I won't.
"I heard the venom in my heart, and it's not all your fault!"
"Mee, my parents don't want me anymore. What am I supposed to do? I don't have a way back."
I don't deserve to be with anyone like this.
"If I'm gone, isn't everything gonna be all right?"
"I sometimes knew that I violated the boundaries of our family, but at that moment, I couldn't control it. My heart, filled with dark thoughts, rage, and they were so happy that I felt an enraged insult to me, filled with 100,000 in my heart."
"It can't be a curse. Believe it, you're a cabbage. He's a pig."
"Come and see you, but you're always hurting yourself, hurting him who loves me, living every day with your own guilt and contradictions, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"I envy people taking pictures of themselves in the circle of friends, and I feel sick when I look at myself."
"You know, it's kind of a deeper topic to talk to, but my friend doesn't want to talk about it because I can easily talk about losing negative energy and then affect her, so I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't talk, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I don't understand my own people and it's hard to be friends."
Nobody likes me.
"It's 3:30 a.m. again, and I feel like I'm crazy, and I'm having nightmares, and I'm in an endless cycle, and I remember that feeling, and I'm really sick, and I'm sick, and I'm sick, and I'm sick, and I'm sick, and I'm sick, and I'm sad, and I'm sad, and the sad, and I'm drowning, and I'm gonna come to you one day, and I don't know if you'll see me laughing at all the things I've left under your microblog, and maybe I can't see you at all."
It's nice to be around. Why do I always want to cry?
I'm really useless.
"A lot of hard nights, tonight being the best, forgive my cowardice tonight, and I want to cry for help."
It's all my fault.
"I don't know what it means to be alive, that friends left Shanghai, that friends saw her and I started to get excited, but I didn't feel anything in the next few hours except emptiness and fear of tomorrow. I haven't seen her. She's a gentle and sincere person, but I don't think I'm gonna make it. It's the big sun out there, but I want to jump from upstairs."
"I'm in a state of disillusionment, emotion, family, economy, my own body, mind, and I'm at my limit, so tell me how I'm going to die without pain."
"It's easy to finish, but it's hard to end."
"I envy people doing what they like, trying to learn to dance, but I can't afford to buy what I like, but I like people who don't like to eat cheese and cake, but my mom doesn't like it, who goes to a good school because it's expensive and nobody wants to hear my story, and I don't feel sad because I'm told to do it, because I can't cry, because I have to be strong in front of my parents and finish this fucking life..."
"""The earth isn't worth it, but you're worth it... forget it. You're not worth it."""
"It's so painful. Every minute, every second."
"You've done something wrong today, you're such a big man, you can't do anything. You really don't know what you're doing."
"Is it necessary to live to be happy? If you're not happy to be alive, it won't be necessary."
"It's like I can't swim when I fall into the sea, and sometimes I'm choked on water, and it's just endless darkness."
It's the same thing every day.
I'm an alien. They can't afford an alien.
"You're wrong, because the whole world says you're wrong, and you're right, you're right, you don't have an absolute feeling, you never know what you're going to do to someone else, and you never know how awful you are."
"Anyway, I can see what you can't see, and I can feel what you can't feel."
"I'm about to get to Qingming, and I'm probably drunk, and I feel like I've got a lot to say, but I'm afraid I'm going to be wrong, and I've been afraid to be heard by the leadership since before, but I'm still mad, because there's something that's always there, and I really want to go back to school, and I really don't want to deal with people, I really want to be simple, I really want everything to be all right."
"So I'm free now, right? What is the reason for being alive? I don't understand? Is it to experience a lot of pain? But there's too much pain, and everything good has lost its mind. Let's go. The world really has nothing to look forward to."
"Sometimes I want to be alone, and no one cares about me, so I can be alone, living alone, living my entire life, and now I'm not, and I care because I seem to be my parents, because they care about me, because I'm gone, and they feel sorry for them, but I'm not saved. I'm a hypocrite, and I'm here to show the other side of my heart."
What's the use of crying? I'd still have to face this damn world if I could die silently.
"It's only here for people like me. There's no one like me in reality. It's weird that one doesn't have a family or friends, but I don't. Maybe I'm the one who made all the mistakes."
I don't think I'll ever get rid of my knot.
I'm so useless.
Every minute is painful.
I really don't know what it means to live forever.
I really just don't want to be understood.
"Thirty-one, five years of business, nothing. My wife doesn't understand me. I want to go. It's too painful to live."
"Actually, my pride is due to my roommate, Good."
"Smile, if you're depressed, don't tell anyone around you because they'll tell you in a pattern."
"It's raining a lot today, and my cellmates are watching me walk in the rain, and there's no umbrella to invite me, and I'm gonna have to run away."
"Sometimes I feel bad about myself. My mom says I don't have any negative energy in the sun, but I don't want to do that."
"How are you doing over there? I've been feeling a little bit bad lately. I don't want to do anything, I'm crying, I'm losing my memory, even my six-year-old son. I'm going to see the hospital, I'm afraid I'm actually doing it, it's really sad, it's really hard."
"I want to die, what do I do? It's hard for me. My life is full of darkness and I can't see light. I'm sorry to be born. I don't want to be human in the next life."
I don't deserve to be loved.
"I think I'm tired. Actually, I kind of wish someone could understand me and know that I'm with me. But I just can't."
"Everyone is selfish, even parents. Well, it's all self-made. If it's over, it's over. You deserve it."
"I've just been diagnosed with moderate depression, I don't want to take my medication, I'm afraid of the side effects. When the family finds out, it says I'm nothing but a disease that I'm thinking of, and I can't wait to die."
"The peculiar thing about depression is that good things get bad, bad things get bad, color blind in the mental world, black and white, only worse."
"If you die, it's better to die; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; as if the air were thin; & nbsp; and faced with unbearable loneliness and fear every moment."
"If I can't help you, give up on me."
My happiness won't last long.
Why have so many things been going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on?
"It's long overdue, isn't it? Why should I be ashamed of myself? People like me have no choice but to die."
"I don't think there's anything special about it. I want a warm, clean family, but I can't bring myself in. My pathological mind can't have a healthy family."
"I met a gentle boy who sang to me, taught me how to learn English, comforted me to live and spend the night chatting with me and said that I was only cute in his eyes. I really thank him, I don't give a shit about everything. But I still don't want to live, and I've ruined all my family, and I don't want to hurt him anymore."
"I'm not really happy to go out with my roommate tomorrow, and I don't even want to go. But I know I can't always be so selfish, and I can't always give people my strange emotions, and I can't control them, but don't let the people around me get affected."
"I suddenly wanted someone to fall in love, men and women could do the same thing, and I wanted to know whether two depressions were together, saving each other or going to the end, and I found that both ends were the same, but no one in the world could save me anymore."
Here I come again. I want to die. I can't. I'm so sorry.
No one can see it.
Me too. Lost the last straw. It's hard to breathe.
"I'm sick of everything in the world, and I'm sick of myself."
"Every time I'm happy, I feel like I'm not myself, like I'm sad. I want to talk, like I used to be."
I'm a chicken and I'm a brother.
"I'm so tired, I want to sleep, and I'm so lonely, and I want to be happy."
I'm disgusting.
"Go see Grandpa and Dad tomorrow. Seriously, I don't have the face to see them. I've messed everything up. I didn't take care of Grandma and Mom, I didn't take care of myself."
"No, it wasn't a good day. I think you should die in a warm bed with a happy smile."
I'm in a bad mood again. I'm not a bad person.
No one saved me.
"Hey, I've come to see you, and I've been really tired yesterday, and I've been trying, and I've been testing, and I've been trying to get a little fat, and I've been home, and I'm tired and I don't have a lot of energy. My tears don't know why I can't stop, and I think I'm going to last. I'm afraid I can't help it, and I have my parents, and I'm not in time. I don't know why I'm human, I'm thinking, it's painful."
"I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to heal for the rest of my life. The most difficult times are the worst words of blood relations. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; & thanks to the fact that I don't have to come back to live in the face of the dead &nbsp; & nbsp; or I'm going to find a place where I don't want to live, or I'm going to lie down and shed my tears. & nbsp; & nbsp; I can't sleep without ever waking up."
"I've been lying to myself for years, feeling that they still love me, but now I realize that this lie is going on."
It's hard to take care of yourself. I really shouldn't have liked someone else.
"I've picked up the pace to find you again. It's true that no one can live without a life, but what's the point of being emptied? I gave up. This time I didn't make him feel guilty, I made him swear. I gave up. I gave up."
Maybe it's not worth it.
Humans really stink.
"I was on a diet in 2017 because of a boy's low self-esteem, and when I wasn't depressed, I felt that depression could attract attention, so I pretended to be someone who could think of making it happen. First, psycho anorexia, then bulimia, and then Prozac was the basic drug, but then I thought I was normal, and once I got in there, no one could save you when I was 16 years old."
I wish I'd died like this. It's another disgusting day. I really can't go on.
"I'm sick and tired of having to go to the bathroom and cry every day from class to school, and I don't remember anything but taking pills all day, and I can't sleep for days."
"I couldn't sleep last night, and I couldn't eat today, and I'm trying to keep everyone away from my plans, and I'm going to make them think I'm okay."
